# Trivia-Game
## Trivia game features
The following features will be part of the game:

Each player is required to enter a name and a room to join a game.

Multiple players can join a single channel/room. Multichannel support isn’t part of MVP(model-view-presenter), so only one game can happen at a time.

Within the game channel/room, we’ll use the following features:

Players can chat with each other in realtime.
Players can view who else is in the room as well as the room they’re currently in.
Any player can initiate a game.
Each player is allowed to submit only one response per player.
Each player must submit a response before the answer can be revealed.
